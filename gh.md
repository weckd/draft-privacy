###### • Privacy:

According to wikipedia,

> **Privacy** is the ability of an individual or group to seclude
> themselves or information about themselves, and thereby express
> themselves
> selectively.<sup>[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy)</sup>

A state of being unobserved, to isolate parts about ourselves, or
information about us, from the public eye.

It is a way for us to have control and autonomy over what personal
things we hold secret, and what things we let other people, groups,
society, organizations know about us. These things may include ones
identity, thoughts, feelings, personal belongings, etc.

The ways privacy of a person is reduced include, collection and
aggregation of information, invasion, intrusion into personal spaces,
the sharing of information shared by a person in confidence without
consent.

Subjectiveness: Privacy inherently is a personal thing, the definitions
above, provide the term with an outline of what would be considered
privacy, but a person defines it for themselves, and gives the term a
clearer version of the definition, themselves. The factors that affect
someone's privacy, things which a person would consider private, would
be set by the person themselves, and to every person they would be
different.

Perception of privacy to every person is subjective, the definition of
privacy provides what it would look like on the outside, not what it
exactly entails.

###### • Internet Privacy:

Information privacy, is where privacy and technology intersect. (also
called data privacy)

Is a subset of information privacy (data privacy) , which refers to the
data and information which is shared, stored, provided and displayed
over the internet.

The Data may include any personally, or non-personally identifiable
information, such as what you search, your activity history, emails,
device identifiers, and much more, collected through the means of
surveillance, tracking or theft.

As technology has advanced, it has created it much easier to intrude and
invade your information, aggregate it in large amounts, and use it for
profit, control, manipulate, and surveillance. But it has also paved way
to protect it better.

###### • Basic Terminology:

-   Anonymity: Anonymity is a state where a persons identity is unknown.

-   Encryption: Encryption is the conversion of data/information into a
    form (code) which is not understandable by third parties.

-   Decryption: Decryption is the conversion of code into
    data/information which is understandable.

-   Cryptography: Is the method used to Encrypt and Decrypt data.

-   Simple Explanation of how Cryptography works:

    -   To put it in the simplest terms, cryptography is taking
        something, putting it in a box and locking it.

    -   The point of cryptography is that only the
        person/group/organization who the data belongs to, and the
        person/group/organization the data is being shared with, can see
        the data and make sense of it.

    -   Types of Cryptography: *(Note: this is a very simplified
        explanation.)*

        1.  Symmetric Cryptography: is when a same key is used to
            encrypt and decrypt data.

        2.  Asymmetric Cryptography: is when different keys are used to
            encrypt and decrypt data.

    -   Cryptography is widely used to protect data shared on the
        internet, while accessing websites, making accounts, storing
        data, sharing data and has a lot of other use cases.

-   Internet Tracking: is the collection of data across the internet and
    tracing it back to users, and can involve profiling, which is the
    process of projecting a collection of data to a certain person.

-   Big Data: The definition of big data is data that contains greater
    variety, arriving in increasing volumes and with more velocity. Put
    simply, big data is larger, more complex data sets, especially from
    new data sources. These data sets are so voluminous that traditional
    data processing software just can’t manage them. [Read

##### Section 2: Why privacy matters

###### • Why Privacy matters:

> ###### Knowledge is power; Knowledge about you is power over you. Your information will be used to anticipate your actions and manipulate the way you shop, vote, and think.<sup>[2](https://github.com/milesmcc/whyprivacymatters#knowledge-is-power-knowledge-about-you-is-power-over-you-your-information-will-be-used-to-anticipate-your-actions-and-manipulate-the-way-you-shop-vote-and-think)</sup>
>
> \- [Whyprivacymatters.org](https://whyprivacymatters.org/)

When you think about privacy, you would consider it for just about, what
you are doing, but privacy is not limited to only our actions, it
extends to us, as an individual.

It not only entails what you are doing, but also who you
are.<sup>[3](https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-privacy-why-your-online-privacy-matters.html)</sup>

Information about you can be used to manipulate your views on things,
limit what you can learn, your reach to knowledge, how you behave, how
you make decisions, and a lot of things in your life.

Sitting on a couch in your living room, doors closed, not being
observed, is a break you as a person need from social situations, when
we are being observed, we act differently because we are aware we are
being observed,

Now imagine, if you were always being observed, will you be able to do
things you would normally do when alone? If your answer is no, then you
understand exactly why privacy matters as a basic human right.

Privacy is not only about our personal development and psychology, it
also plays a big part in being secure,

-   Manipulate how you vote

-   Targeting **marginalized** groups

-   Damaging one's social standing

-   Framing someone as *bad* based on past actions

are some actions, which affect our security and our lives.

##### Section 3: How Private and Secure is the Internet?

###### • Internet and Privacy

It is not that we do not care about privacy why I am writing this guide,
we all do in some part, but as technology develops we have moved a lot
of activities online, which has also allowed governments and companies
to collect more data about us and our activities.

The reason being: *to provide a better experience to users.*

While inherently it is not ill intentioned, and the companies say we can
trust them with our data;

1.  They cannot guarantee the safety of our data forever,

2.  Is the amount of data they collect justified?

3.  Even if the companies say we can trust them, can we? (Transparency)

4.  How ethical are these companies?

5.  Choice; Do we have any/enough choice in what and how much data about
    us is collected?

###### • What is data collection used for?

*(Note: The article is to focus on privacy relating to the internet, and
corporations, I'll add links to read about government surveillance and
privacy intrusion in resources and further reading.)*

If someone asked you what Google's main business is you'll say, "They're
a search company." right? NO.

While the mainly offered service by Google *is* search, they are an
advertising company.

This statistics from 2020 puts Google's ad revenue at more than 80% of
the companies total revenue! ([$146.92
Billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266249/advertising-revenue-of-google/)
out of [$181.69
Billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266206/googles-annual-global-revenue/))

Google trackers are installed over 75% of the top million websites
available on the internet. And next to that is Facebook.

[Source - Are Ads Following
You?](https://spreadprivacy.com/followed-by-ads/)

All over the internet big tech companies are hoarding huge amounts of
user data, not only to create a better user experience, but to sell that
data to ad companies, which use the data to show more relevant ads.
Sounds fair enough considering they provide the services for free, they
do need a source of revenue, but is the amount of data they collect
justifiable? and is it safe to let them do so?

The main reason big tech companies collect the huge amounts of data is
to sell it to advertisers, who use the data to present you with more
relevant ads, to generate more accurate ads, personalised for each and
every user.

On surface, this sounds not so bad, but is it any good for us the users?

There is no simple answer for it, to put it in perspective, advertising
revenue does allow organizations to provide their services and
information for free, data collection in itself is not completely bad or
good, there is no dichotomy, but a huge grey area.

While there are ways, the data can be collected in not harmful ways, can
be used for not harmful purposes, in reality, it is not widely done that
way. The big tech companies which rely on ad revenue, hoard huge amounts
of unnecessary data, and their data collection proposes a lot of harmful
effects to us users, at the end, the only beneficiary is the company
getting the revenue.
